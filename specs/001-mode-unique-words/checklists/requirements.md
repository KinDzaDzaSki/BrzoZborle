# Specification Quality Checklist: Mode-specific unique words

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Validation notes (2025-10-19)

- Clarification Q1 (Mode mapping strategy) resolved: Option A selected and recorded in spec (Classic=identity; Timed=+1; Hard=+floor(N/3)).
- Updated: Timezone and measurement clarifications added to `spec.md`; TypeScript examples moved to `dev-notes.md` for implementers.
- Remaining checklist items to complete: success criteria measurability (SC-002/SC-005) and final feature readiness acceptance checks. These require adding the explicit full-cycle coverage test (T011a) implementation and reporting results.
- Test skeletons created (unit/integration/simulation/audit/perf) to support test-first implementation. Tests are intentionally TODO placeholders until the implementation is available.
- Next step: implement tests and code, run CI to produce pass/fail and then mark the remaining checklist boxes as complete.
- Checklist item "No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain" should be checked after spec saved; the marker was removed and spec updated.
